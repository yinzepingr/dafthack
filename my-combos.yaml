# Ten Flying Fingers (TFF) is a keyboard layout.
# It is optimized for keeping your fingers on the home row.
# https://github.com/guettli/tff

combos:
  # When I select parts with the trackpoint, the right index moves from J
  # to the trackpoint. The middle and ring finger loose their home position, too.
  # The right pinky is the only finger which stays on the home row.
  # "semicolon" (รถ on German keyboards) is below the right pinky finger.
  # It is starting the "navigation combos".

  # Backspace:
  # I use that key often, because I do typos often.
  - keys: semicolon f
    outKeys: backspace

  # Delete:
  # Like backspace, but in the other direction.
  - keys: f semicolon
    outKeys: delete


  # Home (pos1, start of line)
  # "a" is on the left side, that's where Home should move to.
  - keys: semicolon a
    outKeys: home

  # End (end of line)
  # semicolon is at the right side.
  - keys: a semicolon
    outKeys: end

  # Down:
  # Selecting items from an autocomplete list (e.g. in a browser address bar).
  - keys: f n
    outKeys: down

  - keys: f u

  - keys: f m
    outKeys: down

  - keys: f k
    outKeys: left

  - keys: f l
    outKeys: right

  - keys: f i
    outKeys: pageup

  - keys: f comma
    outKeys: pagedown

  # todo: tripple combos do not work yet.
  - keys: d f j
    outKeys: esc

# TODO: I am not sure yet how to trigger ESC, TAB, ENTER.
# Later it would be nice to have shortcuts for ctrl-a, ctrl-x, ctrl-c, ctrl-v. So that my fingers
# can stay on the home row.
# A numeric "layer" would be nice. I could use a "d f" on the right hand, and type numbers with the left hand....
