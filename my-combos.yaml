# It is optimized for keeping your fingers on the home row.

combos:
  # "f" is triggered by my left pointer finger.
  # It gets used for common navigation and backspace/del.

  # I want my "strong" pointer fingers to trigger that key.
  # I do typos often, so I want to be able to quickly correct them.

    outKeys: backspace

  # Down:
  # Selecting items from an autocomplete list (e.g. in a browser address bar).

# TODO: I am not sure yet how to trigger ESC, TAB, ENTER.
# Later it would be nice to have shortcuts for ctrl-a, ctrl-x, ctrl-c, ctrl-v. So that my fingers
# can stay on the home row.
# A numeric "layer" would be nice. I could use a "d f" on the right hand, and type numbers with the left hand....
